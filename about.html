    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Alexis and this is my website Aesthetic Designs. I started making &amp; creating art at a young age; it began with drawing &amp; crafting. As for my future, my true talent was going to be in design &amp; creation.<br>
      <br>
      During my high school years I started to make art &amp; different designs in art sketchbooks. I would use everything from magazine cuttings, book clippings, photographs, drawings, paitings, &amp; much more. I would commonly add in text of my favorite lyrics, quotes, or just from my own thoughts &amp; feelings. I turned these sketchbooks into my own personal expression of design. I have a total of 5 full sketchbooks; I'm presently over halfway through my 6th one. My sketchbooks are something that I hold close to my heart; they are my truest form of creativity.<br>
      <br>
      This love for sketchbooking led me to want to creat collages on a bigger scale. So, I started making huge collages on poster boards. These collages ended up covering entire walls in my bedroom &amp; still do to this day. I love drawing, painting, and writing. I love fashion, so I draw outfits in my free time; my love for fashion &amp; clothes led to me start my own fashion blog on Tumblr. I presently have 3 different Tumblr blogs. Not only is Tumblr amazing because it's full of graphic design inspiration, but my blogs allow me to practice my HTML coding. I am now experienced in web development &amp; design; however, I am continuing to learn more on my own accord. I found creating websites to be fun, yet sometimes tedious or annoying. I know if I continue to gain knowleadge in that area, I am benefiting myself greatly as a graphic designer. I also enjoy creating new graphics and art by using different apps on my computer. I am very into designing, formatting, and fixing; I like my work to be as close to perfect as possible.<br>
      <br>
      I have a Bachelors Degree in Graphic Design &amp; Media Arts. I just graduated in Fall 2021; these past 2 years in school have showed me all the wonders of Graphic Design &amp; the amazing opportunities it holds for me in the future. I have learned more ways to design &amp; create. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Overall, I love creating across many different platforms. My long history of experimentation &amp; play in design has enabled me not only with a fascination in the details, but also with endless creative possibilities. I am passionate about art, imagery, web design, textiles, magazines, fashion, brand identity, &amp; content creation. The use of colors,typography, diverse creative techniques, &amp; experimentation with various types of graphics &amp; materials will always lead me to wonderful creations.</strong></p>
