      <h3>About Me</h3>
		 <p>My name is Alexis and this is my website Aesthetic Designs. I started making &amp; creating art at a young age; it began with drawing &amp; crafting. As for my future, my true talent was going to be in design &amp; creation.<br><br>
		 During my high school years I started to make art &amp; different designs in art sketchbooks. I would use everything from magazine cuttings, book clippings, photographs, drawings, paitings, &amp; much more. I would commonly add in text of my favorite lyrics, quotes, or just from my own thoughts &amp; feelings. I turned these sketchbooks into my own personal expression of design. I have a total of 5 full sketchbooks; I'm presently over halfway through my 6th one. My sketchbooks are something that I hold close to my heart; they are my truest form of creativity.<br><br>
		 This love for sketchbooking led me to want to creat collages on a bigger scale. So, I started making huge collages on poster boards. These collages ended up covering entire walls in my bedroom.<br><br>
		 More recently, I decided to pick back up on drawing. I have always loved fashion, so I started to draw pictures of complete outfits. My love for fashion &amp; clothes led to me starting my own fashion blog on Tumblr. I presently have 3 different Tumblr blogs. Not only is Tumblr amazing because it's full of graphic design inspiration, but it helps me practice HTML coding through their different blog themes.<br><br>
		 2 years ago I went back to college in order to obtain a Bachelors Degree in Graphic Design &amp; Media Arts; with that being said, I am now proud to say that I will be graduating in October 2021. These past 2 years have showed me all the wonders of Graphic Design &amp; the amazing opportunities it holds for me in the future. I have learned more ways to design &amp; create, not to mention how to turn it into a profession. I love making advertisements, flyers, magazine pages, brochures, stationeries, logos, menus, and even calendars! I also love creating websites!<br><br> 
		 I recently worked for a Brand Media Company; my job was to create social media ads for the company's clients. I made instagram &amp; facebook ads for a variety of different businesses.</p>
		 <p><strong>Overall, my long history of experimentation &amp; play in design has enabled me not only with a fascination in the details, but also with endless creative possibilities. I am passionate about art, imagery, web design, textiles, magazines, fashion, brand identity, &amp; content creation. The use of colors,typography, diverse creative techniques, &amp; experimentation with various types of graphics &amp; materials will always lead me to wonderful creations.</strong>   </p>
